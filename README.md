# COVID-19 Forecasting in the United States (Machine Learning Project)
This project aims to analyse COVID-19 case, death, and vaccination data from the United States, and use time series machine learning algorithms (Prophet) to make a short-term forecast for weekly number of cases. Included in this repository are a pptx (Powerpoint) file presenting my findings, a ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) file containing the code which I used for analysis and machine learning, as well as a folder called 'data source' which contains five csv files pertaining to COVID-19 data within. 

All data used in this project is sourced from the COVID Data Tracker of the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention): https://covid.cdc.gov/
